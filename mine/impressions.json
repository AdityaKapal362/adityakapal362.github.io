He is THE go-to person to ask questions for, and you will be 100% sure that he will answer.\n\nDespite his expertise, his humbleness is just immeasurable; I just can't be the same as him. He's like that one guy in a school project that carries your whole team, and said like it's nothing.\n\nAdityaKapal is totally underrated, I am just sad how he's practically invisible these days. Well yeah, understandably he has college to attend to; but seriously, he deserves more exposure!"

He made some of the best apps in Sketchware that was thought to be impossible, even earned multiple Editor's Choice in the shared projects section of Sketchware! I was really amazed and wanted to know more on how he did it, and he is really nice! He introduced me to his Indonesian community, helped me with my problems in Sketchware, and later on became a good friend and we would talk about random things!"
